Hello friends 👋🏽

I am getting married!! To my best friend from college, Haritha.

* Prologue: Wow that is huge!! last minute?!
* Our story
* Epilogue: Okay, now what do I do?

## Prologue

YESS!! I am really excited, tensed, and tiredd at the same time. As I write this it is 3 am IST and I have jumped from one task after the other without completing any of them well.

Why is this marriage date appearing in front of me x hours before the D-day?

Yes. This is last minute. Nobody does a wedding like this. Let me explain why.

Haritha and I decided to get married in Chennai, India and were considering dates for 2022 in Feb this year. Consider the equation below for determining a wedding date 'D'

D = f(a,b,c)
where,
a= your and your spouse-tobe's availability
b= family's availability
c= required planning period
d= our sanity

However, Haritha and I being being located in (the great!?:o) country of United States, we add more 

x= Visa stamping availbility provided by the consulate in India
y= USCIS's efficiency in sending your paperwork in time

Now, x and y, took over all of our sanity and made planning period literally, five days. So here we are.
If you want to know more about x and y, see here and here.

Moving on, if you are interested in our story- how we met, blah blah- written in half-romantic, half-academic style, see below.
