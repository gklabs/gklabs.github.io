👨🏽‍🎓 Professional 
===============
I am always looking out for opportunities to collaborate for my research. Here is my [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giridharkaushik/). If you think you know an organization, person whom you think I should get in touch with, please [email](gramacha@gmu.edu) me. Here is my updated resume and research statement.

 🤝 Mentorship
===============
I specialise in machine learning, Natural language processing, optimization and I would like to be mentored in the field of Human Comupter Interaction, Applied Cognition and Neuroscience. If you or someone you know is an expert in the areas, I would surely like to talk to them. Please get in touch with email.

📚 Books
===============
I have an active list of books that I would like to read on my [read.gift](https://read.gift/u/gkbytes) profile. You can buy me a book there. Most of my notes on these books are usually open source maintained on my [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/thoughtdump/page/4EGw2lkJd).

🎮 Gear
===============
I am working to set up my workspace to be a productive and creative space. I have a [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/24OW7TQT83T2P?ref_=wl_share) on Amazon for the gear I am saving up for. 

✊🏾 Miscellanea

* 🎬 Youtube - My YouTube is nascent and I am working to learn to make my content high quality. If you are an expert in video editing, lets talk.
